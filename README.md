# Udacity-Course-Projects
This is the first README file I have created.
The files in this repository are small projects which I completed during the 'Introduction to Programming' course run by Udacity
They include:
- a text based adventure game written in Python
- a game of rock, paper and scissors written in Python
- a shopping cart for a fruit shop written in JS
