# Udacity-Course-Projects
This is the first README file I have created.
The files in this repository are small projects which I completed during the 'Introduction to Programming' course run by Udacity
They include:
- a text based adventure game written in Python (game_challenge.py)
- a game of rock, paper and scissors written in Python (rps.py)
- a JS code for the shopping cart functionality for a fruit shop (script.js)
